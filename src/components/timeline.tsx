This cut ingestion times from 5 minutes to under 20 seconds, boosting throughput and reducing system impact. The new architecture eliminated multi-day job failures by enabling recovery from previously collected batches.  Persisted batches could be replayed to quickly reproduce errors without impacting customers. Decoupling ingestion from downstream processes increased fault tolerance and enabled parallel processing, reducing recovery times from days to seconds and scaling to millions of logs daily.`,

The focus was on improving flexibility, maintainability, and support for complex queries across multiple engines, including proprietary and external sources like Snowflake. We introduced a new batch processing module to streamline new parsers and reduce code duplication. By enforcing schema throughout the pipeline, we enriched lineage tracking and improved troubleshooting. The refactor followed SOLID object oriented design principles, reducing technical debt while maintaining performance and avoiding downtime, resulting in a scalable and reliable solution.`,
